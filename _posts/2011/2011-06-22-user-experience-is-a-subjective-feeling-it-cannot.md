> User experience is a subjective feeling; it cannot actually be ‘designed’. Instead, you can design for a user experience, trying to enable certain kind of experiences. The scope of the field is directed at affecting ‘all aspects of the user’s interaction with the product: how it is perceived, learned, and used.’
