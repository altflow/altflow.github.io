Quick translation of the following article.

- [Skypeで知り合った人の実名を知る方法](http://anond.hatelabo.jp/20110402221010)

I’m not sure if this would work now and future. It doesn’t seem mac version
have facebook feature as of June 21, 2011.

1. Update skype (sidenote: the original article was posted on April 22, 2011)
2. Open facebook tab in Skype home 
3. Display news feed on skype

If the user uses same email address on skype and facebook, you can get the
user’s name of his/her facebook account whatever the privacy settings.
