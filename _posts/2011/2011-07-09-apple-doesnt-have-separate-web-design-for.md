According to the article, the author find out that

- Apple sets “viewport” width as 1024px, which is rendered as if 1024px width
in mobile browser (mobile safari).
- Basically each page has large image at top of the page. And 3 - 4 images lined
up in 4 columns under the large image.
- When you double tap a small image, mobile safari zooms the contents and it
fits the screen size. At this point, you can easily read the text with the image.

and then you can access information that you want with double tap. The author
