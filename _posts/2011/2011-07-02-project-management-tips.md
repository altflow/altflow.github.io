I picked up some points that I sympathized in the following article which is written
about key factors for successful project management.

- [プロジェクトマネジメントのノウハウ（2011/4）](http://dorablue.blog51.fc2.com/blog-entry-3486.html)

### Lead

- Mid - Long term success should be growth of team member and team members
would think that  they want to work together again

### Flat

- Project leader, project member are just different roles, it doesn’t mean high, low positions
- To make good atmosphere, the leader should talk honestly

### Pride

- Give a praise in front of everyone, give a warning one on one

### Communication

- Have regular one on one meeting to know everyone’s feeling

### Closing

- Evaluation and reflection should be straight and strict

### Reporting

- Leader want to know conclusion. Sub-leader want to know process as well.
Team member want to know how to. Thus the report should begin conclution,
and then process and how to at the end

### Vacation

- When a person want to take a day off, there is not benefit to hold him back
